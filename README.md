# 2017-jserv-summery-system-software

This repository served as the notes and reference of system software course taught by jserv.
Since the course itself is more like marking the main point for students instead of teaching
the details of a specific area, I will gradually add what I've learned from those subjects,
such as concurrent programming, compiler design, and os.
